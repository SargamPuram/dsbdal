ðŸ§¾ How to Explain the Code and Output (in your own words):
"I used Seaborn's boxplot() function to visualize the distribution of passenger ages based on gender and survival status using the Titanic dataset.
The x-axis represents gender ('sex'), the y-axis represents passenger age, and the color hue indicates whether the person survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
This allows us to compare how age varied among males and females, and how it related to their chances of survival."

âœ… Observations to Say in Viva:
Among females, survivors generally have a lower median age compared to non-survivors.

Among males, thereâ€™s a wider age range among non-survivors â€” with both very young and older individuals dying.

Survivors tend to be slightly younger overall, especially young children who were prioritized during rescue.

Box size and whiskers help show how spread out the ages are for each group.

Among females, those who survived tended to be slightly younger than those who didnâ€™t.

Among males, both survivors and non-survivors have a similar median age, but:

Non-surviving males had a wider age spread, meaning more variability.

Some very young children survived, visible in the lower whiskers.

The interquartile range (IQR) of survivors is generally lower, especially in females â€” suggesting younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate, especially women.



ðŸŽ¤ Possible Viva Questions & Model Answers
ðŸ”¹ Q1. What is a box plot and why did you use it here?
A box plot shows the distribution of a continuous variable (like age), including the median, quartiles, and outliers.
I used it here to compare the age distributions of passengers based on gender and survival status, all in one graph.

ðŸ”¹ Q2. What does the 'hue' parameter do in your code?
The hue="survived" parameter splits each gender into two groups â€” those who survived and those who didn't â€” using different colors for visual comparison.

ðŸ”¹ Q3. What do the box and whiskers represent?
The box shows the interquartile range (IQR): 25th to 75th percentile.

The line inside the box is the median (50th percentile).

The whiskers extend to show the range of the data (excluding outliers).

Dots outside whiskers are outliers.

ðŸ”¹ Q4. What inference can you make about survival and age from this plot?
From the plot, we can infer that younger females and children were more likely to survive.
Males had a lower survival rate overall, and many older males didnâ€™t survive.
The distribution also suggests that age was an influencing factor, especially for females.

ðŸ”¹ Q5. What does it mean if the box is taller or wider?
A taller box means greater variability in age within that group.
A shorter box means the ages are more concentrated around the median.

ðŸ”¹ Q6. Why do some groups have dots (outliers)?
Those dots are individuals whose ages were unusually high or low compared to others in their group. They're called outliers.
